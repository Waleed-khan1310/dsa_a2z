1.Definition of Recursion:-
When a function calls itself again and again, until a specific
condition met.
=> If there is no condition the funtion will execute infinite time

2.Stack overflow:-
When there is no base condition given for a particular recursive 
function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a Stack 
Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and 
hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.

3.Base condition:-
It is the condition that is written in a recursive function in order 
for it to get completed and not to run infinitely. After encountering 
the base condition, the function terminates and returns back to its 
parent function simultaneously.

4.Recursive Tree:-
A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which 
depicts how functions are called and returned as a series of events 
happening consecutively


5.Recursive way of calculating the sum of first N Natural Numbers:-

i.Parameterized Way.
ii.Functional Way.

i.Parameterized way:-
In this approach, instead of using a global variable for calculating the sum, we pass the sum in the 
parameters of the function each time we add an integer to it during the function call.
