Definition of Recursion
When a function calls itself again and again, until a specific
condition met.
=> If there is no condition the funtion will execute infinite time

Stack overflow
When there is no base condition given for a particular recursive 
function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a Stack 
Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and 
hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.

#Base condition
It is the condition that is written in a recursive function in order 
for it to get completed and not to run infinitely. After encountering 
the base condition, the function terminates and returns back to its 
parent function simultaneously.

Recursive Tree
A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which 
depicts how functions are called and returned as a series of events 
happening consecutively
